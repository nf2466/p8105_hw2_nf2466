## Problem 1
Read the Mr. Trash Wheel data set
```{r}
trashwheel_df=
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
    mutate(
      sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
      sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read in precipitation data for 2017 and 2018

```{r}
precip_2018 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet="2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  )%>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month)%>%
  mutate(year=2018)%>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet="2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  )%>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month)%>%
  mutate(year=2017)%>%
  relocate(year)

```
Now combine annual precipitation

```{r}
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

```
Switch month variable from number to character
```{r}
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

left_join(precip_df,month_df, by = "month")

```
This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trash Wheel trash collector in Baltimore, MD. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trash wheel collects trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains information on year, month, and trash collected, including some specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 
`r nrow(trashwheel_df)` in our final dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. 

* The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was `r trashwheel_df %>% filter(year == 2017) %>% pull(sports_balls) %>% median()`
* The total precipitation in 2018 was `r precip_df %>% filter(year == 2018) %>% pull(total) %>% sum()` inches.
