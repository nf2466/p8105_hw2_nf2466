## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trash Wheel data set

``` r
trashwheel_df=
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
    mutate(
      sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
      sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read in precipitation data for 2017 and 2018

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet="2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  )%>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month)%>%
  mutate(year=2018)%>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet="2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1,
  )%>%
  janitor:: clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month)%>%
  mutate(year=2017)%>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
```

Switch month variable from number to character

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

left_join(precip_df,month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trash Wheel trash
collector in Baltimore, MD. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trash
wheel collects trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, including some specific
kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 in our final dataset.
Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

Read in Subway Entrance and Exit Data

``` r
subway_df=
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  select(line:entry,vending,ada)%>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = "TRUE", NO = "FALSE"))%>%
  mutate(entry = as.logical(entry))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information about subway stations in NYC. It
contains information on subway line, station, latitude/longitude, which
routes it serves, entrance type, whether there are vending machines, and
its ADA compliance. To read this dataset, I imported a csv file, cleaned
the names, selected the columns I wanted to keep, and changed the entry
variable from a character variable to a logical variable. There are a
total of 1868 rows and 19 columns. The dataset appears to overall be
tidy except for the route variables .

There are 465 distinct stations in this dataset. There are 84 distinct
stations that are ADA compliant. The proportion of station
entrances/exits with no vending that allow entry is 0.3770492.

``` r
subway_tidy =
  subway_df %>%
  mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>%
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, names_to = "route_name", names_prefix = "route", values_to = "route_number") %>%
  drop_na(route_number)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. There are 17
stations on the A line that are ADA compliant.
